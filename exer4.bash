# Write a shell script to check to see if the file "/etc/shadow" exists. If it
# does exist, display "Shadow passwords are enabled." Next, check to see if you
# can write to the file. If you can, display "You have permissions to edit /etc/shadow."
# If you cannot, display "You do NOT have permissions to edit /etc/shadow."
